<h1>The Best Marvel Movies According to Kevin</h1>
<h2>My top 2 Marvel movies of all-times</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>Several Reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How the director separate our heroes into different places (and showing in different cut scenes). And each of them have to use their own way to deal with the main boss (Thanos)</li>
    <li>How the link all the superheroes together.</li>
    <li>I think this is the only superheroes movie with bad ending (Where good guy lost the fight at the end)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Captain America: The winter soldier</h3>
<p>Not much reason, except for good story, best action scenes, and yeah thats all.</p>
